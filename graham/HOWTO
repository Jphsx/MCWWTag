Justin's current set up builds this code as part of MarlinKinfitProcessors.

So.

cd ../../MarlinKinfitProcessors


mkdir build
cd build
cmake -C $ILCSOFT/ILCSoft.cmake ..

# Then various ways ..
make
make -j4 install
make 2>my.err 1>my.log


Also need

vertexInfo.cc
tauUtils.cc
tauInfo.cc
particleInfo.cc
