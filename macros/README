scripts and macros

MakeHistograms.sh 
assumes existence of file_LR.root and file_RL.root containing the TTree from Marlin runs on WW, and 
makes histograms from those tree variables relating to MC 4-fermion info.

Output histograms are in out_LR.root and out_RL.root.

MakePlots.sh makes plots contrasting LR with RL beam polarizations

MakeFourPlots.sh makes plots contrasting u,d,l,v fermion characteristics.
